# Selenium Accessibility Testing

## Overview

This repository provides a setup for running Selenium-based accessibility tests on a webpage. It includes a script that automates interactions with a webpage and performs accessibility checks using `axe-selenium-python`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
3. **Install Dependencies**

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver_manager
pip install axe-selenium-python
```

## Script
The repository includes a script for performing accessibility checks. Save the code to a file named `ally.py`


## Running the Script
Run the script using:

```bash

python ally.py
```
## Main Violation
The following key accessibility issue was found:

**Color Contrast**
<br>
- Description: Ensures the contrast between foreground and background colors meets WCAG 2 AA contrast ratio thresholds.
- Issue: An element on the page has insufficient color contrast. The foreground color (#ffffff) and background color (#ffa370) have a contrast ratio of 1.95, while the expected ratio is 4.5:1.
- Impact: Serious
- Help: Color Contrast Guidelines
- "HelpUrl": "https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/color-contrast?application=axeAPI"
- Example: The "Submit" button does not meet the required contrast ratio. Here's the HTML for the problematic element:
```html

<button type="submit" class="section__submit-btn">Submit</button>
```
Contribution
Iâ€™m interested in improving this testing setup. If you have suggestions or can enhance the script to cover incomplete checks or address the main violations, please fork this repository and submit a pull request.
